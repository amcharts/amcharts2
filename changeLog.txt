Since v 2.5 we no longer distribute our old flash charts in this package, we hope this
will help to avoid a lot of misunderstandings. If you still want to use flash charts,
download them in a separate package from www.amcharts.com/download/

We added a lot of new examples, to the "samples" folder. They are better structured,
source code commented.

BIG NEW FEATURES:

Automatic margins
margins of RectangularChart (Serial and XY charts) are calculated automatically now. 
You can still work in old way by setting margins manually - set chart.autoMargins to
false.
 
Axis titles
Previously you had to use addLabel method in order to give name to the axis. Since
this version we introduced title property for AxisBase, so you can name both Category
and Value Axes now much more easily.

Chart title
Same as with axes titles - previously you had to use addLabel method to name a chart.
Now you can add any number of titles using 
chart.addTitle(text, size, color, alpha, bold) method. Chart title is taken into account
when calculating margins, also position of pie/radar center.

Trend lines
Chart can display Trend lines now.

AmCharts.ready() method added so you don't need to use window.onload anymore. You can
use amCharts.ready as many times in one page as you want. 

NOT SO BIG NEW FEATURES:

precision property added to ValueAxis.

if chart.usePrefixes is set, prefixes will be used both in balloons and legend, not only
by valueAxis as before.


SOME OTHER THINGS TO MENTION:

default value of autoGridCount property of AxisBase changed to true

default value of textClickEnabled of AmLegend changed to false

default value of hideResizeGrips of ChartScrollbar changed to false

All margins of RectangularChart changed to 20, as they can still be used for sides
without axes.

FEATURE:
you can use custom tags like [[myCustomField]] in labelText / balloonText. If data item
from your data provider has such field, the tag will be replaced with this value.

FIXES:
[[percents]] were not displayed in stacked chart labels.
labels on the 3D columns were positioned in wrong position in some cases.

2.4.6
FIXES:
if chartCursor.pan was set to true, mouse pointer didn't change back when off the area.

in some cases balloon flashed in a wrong position (IE only) for a second.

amFallback used to fail on older IE with <visible_in_legend> set to false.

Rollover balloons used to overlap when all of the datapoints were very near the top of 
the plot area.

Sometimes lines became blurry after window was resized.

v16 of Chrome used to display warning about deprecated layerX and layerY properties

guides on CategoryAxis with not date based values used not to work properly.

Some other minor bugs fixed.

FEATURES:

boldPeriodBeginning property with default value true added to CoordinateAxis.
You can disable bolding of the beginning of a period (like year/month/etc) using
it.

We used Google's Closure Compiler (http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home)
app to optimize the code and now size of amCharts is less by ~13 KB!

at a time will be displayed. Default value is false.

JavaScript version of XY Chart is now available. 
Code was optimized so even with this new chart the size of a file got smaller!
Some minor bugs fixed in JS version.

might cause some unsolvable bugs.

2.1.5
Fix in JavaScript version:
Some garbage used to appear on plot area while zooming candlestick chart.

2.1.4

Fixes / tweaks in JavaScript version:

If duration of ValueAxis is set, value balloons now also display duration.

If a label was added with chart.addLabel method after the chart is created, these
labels used to dissapear after validateNow() methos was called.

Some issues with positive/negative graph masking fixed.

If graph type was column, startDuration was > 0, and there were values equal to 0,
an error used to happen with Chrome while animating.

Legend marker type "bubble" wasn't working at all.

Legend marker type "line" or "dashed line" wasn't registering clicks on the marker. 
 
2.1.0
Radar/Polar chart added to JavaScript charts
Some bug fixes/tweaks in both flash and JavaScript versions.


2.0.7
Memory leaks fixed and performance inproved for JavaScript version.


2.0.6
Changes in JavaScript version:
We strongly recommend upgrading to this version, as it contains some important
updates and fixes.

One important change which might affect chart behavior on touch devices was made.
As our charts have a possibility to zoom-in or scroll, we are capturing touch events
and zoom or pan or scroll the chart if such event happens. This means that if a
chart is on a page, and user is moving a page with a finger, the page won't move if
he touches the chart first. Understanding that in most cases moving a page is a
primary purpose of a user, we disabled our pan behaviors by default. If you think
that selecting or or panning the chart is a primary purpose of your chart users,
you should set:

chart.panEventsEnabled = true;

Another important fix - the charts were redrawing when browser was resized even
if chart containers size didn't changed. This affected performance a lot.

Some other minor fixes were made.


2.0.5
Changes in JavaScript version:
Some minor bugs fixed.


2.0.4
Changes in JavaScript version:
gridPosition property with possible values "start" and "middle" added to CategroryAxis;
usePrefixes added to valueAxis;


2.0.3
Changes in JavaScript version:
Mouse and text related problems which appeared in newly released IE9 were fixed.
